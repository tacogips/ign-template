# Review and Improve Current Work

Review all modifications made in this session, summarize improvements over initial approaches, and verify consistency.

## Instructions

1. **Review git diff**: Run `git diff` to see all uncommitted changes

2. **Summarize improvements**: Identify places where the approach was improved compared to the initial implementation:
   - What was the initial approach?
   - What improvement was made?
   - Why is it better?

3. **Check consistency**: Verify that all modifications follow the same patterns and conventions:
   - Are similar problems solved the same way?
   - Is the formatting/syntax consistent?
   - Are there any inconsistencies that need to be fixed?

4. **Fix inconsistencies**: If inconsistencies are found, fix them to ensure all changes use the best approach consistently

5. **Report findings**: Provide a summary of:
   - Improvements made during the session
   - Consistency issues found and fixed
   - Final state of all changes

## Expected Output
