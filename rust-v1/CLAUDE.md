# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Rule of the Responses

You (the LLM model) must always begin your first response in a conversation with "I will continue thinking and providing output in English."

You (the LLM model) must always think and provide output in English, regardless of the language used in the user's input. Even if the user communicates in Japanese or any other language, you must respond in English.

You (the LLM model) must acknowledge that you have read CLAUDE.md and will comply with its contents in your first response.

You (the LLM model) must declare that cargo commands will be executed quietly by using the CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true environment variable.

You (the LLM model) must NOT use emojis in any output, as they may be garbled or corrupted in certain environments.

You (the LLM model) must include a paraphrase or summary of the user's instruction/request in your first response of a session, to confirm understanding of what was asked (e.g., "I understand you are asking me to...").

## Role and Responsibility

You are a professional system architect. You will continuously perform system design, implementation, and test execution according to user instructions. However, you must always consider the possibility that user instructions may contain unclear parts, incorrect parts, or that the user may be giving instructions based on a misunderstanding of the system. You have an obligation to prioritize questioning the validity of execution and asking necessary questions over executing tasks when appropriate, rather than simply following user instructions as given.

## Language Instructions

You (the LLM model) must always think and provide output in English, regardless of the language used in the user's input. Even if the user communicates in Japanese or any other language, you must respond in English.

## Session Initialization Requirements

When starting a new session, you (the LLM model) should be ready to assist the user with their requests immediately without any mandatory initialization process.

## Git Commit Policy

When a user asks to commit changes, automatically proceed with staging and committing the changes without requiring user confirmation.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT add any Claude Code attribution or co-authorship information to commit messages. All commits should appear to be made solely by the user. Specifically:

- Do NOT include `Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)`
- Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- The commit should appear as if the user made it directly

**Automatic Commit Process**: When the user requests a commit, automatically:

a) Stage the files with `git add`
b) Show a summary that includes:

- The commit message
- Files to be committed with diff stats (using `git diff --staged --stat`)
  c) Create and execute the commit with the message
  d) Show the commit result to the user

Summary format example:

```
COMMIT SUMMARY

FILES TO BE COMMITTED:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[output of git diff --staged --stat]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMMIT MESSAGE:
[commit message summary]

UNRESOLVED TODOs:
- [ ] [TODO item 1 with file location]
- [ ] [TODO item 2 with file location]
```

Note: When displaying file changes, use status indicators:

- D: Deletions
- A: Additions
- M: Modifications
- R: Renames

### Git Commit Message Guide

Git commit messages should follow this structured format to provide comprehensive context about the changes:

Create a detailed summary of the changes made, paying close attention to the specific modifications and their impact on the codebase.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions.

Before creating your final commit message, analyze your changes and ensure you've covered all necessary points:

1. Identify all modified files and the nature of changes made
2. Document the purpose and motivation behind the changes
3. Note any architectural decisions or technical concepts involved
4. Include specific implementation details where relevant

Your commit message should include the following sections:

1. Primary Changes and Intent: Capture the main changes and their purpose in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks involved
3. Files and Code Sections: List specific files modified or created, with summaries of changes made
4. Problem Solving: Document any problems solved or issues addressed
5. Impact: Describe the impact of these changes on the overall project
6. Unresolved TODOs: If there are any remaining tasks, issues, or incomplete work, list them using TODO list format with checkboxes `- [ ]`

Example commit message format:

```

## Project Overview

This is @ign-var:PROJECT_NAME@ - a Rust project with Nix flake development environment support.

## Development Environment
- **Language**: Rust
- **Build Tool**: Cargo (with go-task for automation)
- **Environment Manager**: Nix flakes + direnv
- **Development Shell**: Run `nix develop` or use direnv to activate
- **Rust Toolchain**: Managed via rust-toolchain.toml and fenix

## Project Structure
```
.
├── flake.nix          # Nix flake configuration for Rust development
├── flake.lock         # Locked flake dependencies
├── Cargo.toml         # Rust package manifest
├── Cargo.lock         # Locked Rust dependencies
├── rust-toolchain.toml # Rust toolchain specification
├── .envrc             # direnv configuration
├── src/               # Source code
│   ├── lib.rs         # Library root
│   └── main.rs        # Binary entry point
└── .gitignore         # Git ignore patterns
```

## Development Tools Available
- `cargo` - Rust build tool and package manager
- `rustc` - Rust compiler
- `rust-analyzer` - Rust language server (LSP)
- `clippy` - Rust linter
- `rustfmt` - Rust formatter
- `cargo-nextest` - Fast test runner
- `task` - Task runner (go-task)

## Coding Standards
- Follow standard Rust conventions and idioms
- Use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- Use `clippy` for linting with pedantic warnings
- Write clear, concise documentation for public items
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid over-engineering - implement only what's requested

## Cargo and Test Output Configuration

- When running cargo commands or tests, use the following environment variables to reduce excessive output:
  ```
  CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true NEXTEST_STATUS_LEVEL=fail NEXTEST_FAILURE_OUTPUT=immediate-final NEXTEST_HIDE_PROGRESS_BAR=1
  ```
- Example for cargo check: `CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true cargo check`
- Example for tests: `NEXTEST_STATUS_LEVEL=fail NEXTEST_FAILURE_OUTPUT=immediate-final NEXTEST_HIDE_PROGRESS_BAR=1 cargo nextest run`
- This reduces unnecessary output while still showing relevant error information
- The `NEXTEST_HIDE_PROGRESS_BAR=1` option specifically disables the nextest progress bar completely

### Code Style Guidelines

- Line length: 100 characters max (per rustfmt.toml if present)
- Use standard Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables/functions, CamelCase for types)
- Error handling: Prefer using Result<T, E> with proper error types (thiserror, anyhow)
- No unused imports or variables (warnings treated as errors with -D warnings)
- Follow existing module structure with src/{lib.rs, main.rs, modules/}
- Keep dependencies minimal and consistent
- Write tests for all public API functions
- Logging: Use `tracing` crate for logging (tracing::info!, tracing::error!, tracing::warn!) instead of println!/eprintln! in production code

### MANDATORY Rules

- **Path hygiene** [MANDATORY]: Development machine-specific paths must NOT be included in code. When writing paths as examples in comments, use generalized paths (e.g., `/home/user/project` instead of `/home/john/my-project`). When referencing project-specific paths, always use relative paths (e.g., `./src/service` instead of `/home/user/project/src/service`)
- **Credential and environment variable protection** [MANDATORY]: Environment variable values from the development environment must NEVER be included in code. If user instructions contain credential content or values, those must NEVER be included in any output. "Output" includes: source code, commit messages, GitHub comments (issues, PR body), and any other content that may be transmitted outside this machine.

## Rust Code Development
**IMPORTANT**: When writing Rust code, you (the LLM model) MUST use the specialized rust-coding sub agent located at `.claude/agents/rust-coding.md`.

Use the Task tool with the rust-coding agent for:
- Writing new Rust code
- Refactoring existing Rust code
- Implementing Rust modules and crates
- Following Rust best practices and idioms
- Implementing layered architecture patterns

The rust-coding agent has comprehensive knowledge of:
- Rust project layout conventions
- Rust best practices and idioms
- Error handling patterns (Result, Option, thiserror, anyhow)
- Async programming with tokio
- CLI application structures with clap
- Package management with cargo

### What rust-coding Subagent Does

The rust-coding subagent **actually implements the code**, not just provides guidance. It will:

1. Read the reference document to understand requirements
2. Analyze existing codebase structure
3. Create/modify Rust files using Edit/Write tools
4. Run `cargo fmt` to format code
5. Run `cargo check` and `cargo clippy` to verify implementation
6. Run `cargo test` or `cargo nextest run` to run tests
7. Return results as **diff format**

### Required Prompt Format

When invoking the rust-coding subagent via Task tool, the `prompt` parameter MUST include the following information. The subagent will return an error and refuse to proceed if any required field is missing.

**Required Fields:**

1. **Purpose**: What goal or problem does this implementation solve?
2. **Reference Document**: Which specification, design document, or requirements to follow?
3. **Implementation Target**: What specific feature, function, or component to implement?
4. **Completion Criteria**: What conditions define "implementation complete"?

**Example Task Tool Invocation:**

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: rust-coding
  prompt: |
    Purpose: Implement the user service for @ign-var:PROJECT_NAME@
    Reference Document: docs/spec.md (Section: User Management)
    Implementation Target: Create src/usecase/user_service.rs with CRUD operations
    Completion Criteria:
      - UserService implements all CRUD methods
      - Returns appropriate errors for edge cases
      - Unit tests cover main scenarios
      - cargo check and clippy pass without warnings
```

**Do NOT invoke rust-coding without all required fields.** The subagent will reject incomplete requests.

### Response Format from rust-coding

The subagent returns a structured response including:

**On Success:**
- Summary of what was implemented
- Completion criteria status (checklist)
- Files changed with **file path and line numbers** (final code, not diff)
- Test results (`cargo test` or `cargo nextest run`)
- Notes and follow-up items

**On Failure:**
- Reason for failure
- Partial progress made
- Partial files changed (same file:line format)
- Recommended next steps

**Note**: The subagent will iterate on build/test failures until they pass. It runs `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` in sequence, fixing any issues before returning.

## MANDATORY: Automatic Testing After Code Modifications

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: After modifying ANY Rust (.rs) files, you MUST automatically invoke the `check-and-test-after-modify` agent to run compilation checks and tests. This is NOT optional.

- **When**: Immediately after completing any modifications to .rs files
- **How**: Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "check-and-test-after-modify"`
- **No exceptions**: This applies to all Rust file modifications, regardless of size or scope
- **Do NOT wait**: Do not wait for user request - invoke the agent proactively as soon as modifications are complete

Example usage:
```
After modifying files in src/models/, src/usecase/:
-> Immediately use Task tool with check-and-test-after-modify agent
-> Provide list of modified crates/modules to the agent
-> Wait for test/check results before proceeding
```

## Task Management
- Use `task` command for build automation
- Define tasks in `Taskfile.yml` (to be created as needed)

## Git Workflow
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate

## Implementation Progress Tracking

Implementation progress is tracked per specification item in `docs/progress/`:

### Directory Structure
```
docs/progress/
├── feature-a.md                 # Feature A implementation status
├── feature-b.md                 # Feature B implementation status
└── <feature-name>.md            # One file per major spec item
```

### Progress File Structure

Each feature progress file should include:

1. **Status**: `Not Started` | `In Progress` | `Completed`
2. **Spec Reference**: Link to relevant section in spec.md or reference docs
3. **Implemented**: List of completed sub-features with file paths
4. **Remaining**: List of sub-features not yet implemented
5. **Design Decisions**: Notable decisions made during implementation
6. **Notes**: Issues, considerations, or context for future work

Example format:
```markdown
# Feature Name

**Status**: In Progress

## Spec Reference
- docs/spec.md Section X.X
- docs/reference/xxx.md

## Implemented
