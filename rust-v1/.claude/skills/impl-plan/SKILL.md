# Implementation Plan Skill

This skill provides guidelines for creating and managing implementation plans from design documents.

## When to Apply

Apply this skill when:
- Translating design documents into actionable implementation plans
- Planning multi-session implementation work
- Breaking down large features into parallelizable subtasks
- Tracking implementation progress across sessions

## Purpose

Implementation plans bridge the gap between design documents (what to build) and actual implementation (how to build). They provide:
- Clear deliverables without code
- Trait and function specifications
- Dependency mapping for concurrent execution
- Progress tracking across sessions

## Output Location

**IMPORTANT**: All implementation plans MUST be stored under `impl-plans/` subdirectories.

```
impl-plans/
├── README.md              # Index of all implementation plans
├── active/                # Currently active implementation plans
│   └── <feature>.md       # One file per feature being implemented
├── completed/             # Completed implementation plans (archive)
│   └── <feature>.md       # Completed plans for reference
└── templates/             # Plan templates
    └── plan-template.md   # Standard plan template
```

## Directory Rules

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `impl-plans/active/` | Implementation plans currently in progress |
| `impl-plans/completed/` | Archived completed plans for reference |
| `impl-plans/templates/` | Plan templates and examples |

**DO NOT** create implementation plan files outside `impl-plans/`.

## Implementation Plan Structure

Each implementation plan file MUST include:

### 1. Header Section
```markdown
# <Feature Name> Implementation Plan

**Status**: Planning | Ready | In Progress | Completed
**Design Reference**: design-docs/specs/<file>.md#<section>
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 2. Design Document Reference
- Link to specific design document section
- Summary of what is being implemented
- Scope boundaries (what is NOT included)

### 3. Implementation Overview
- High-level approach description
- Key architectural decisions for implementation
- Dependencies on other features/systems

### 4. Deliverables

Each deliverable MUST specify:
- File path (where the code will live)
- Purpose (what this file/module does)
- Exports (functions, traits, structs with their purposes)
- Dependencies (what it depends on)
- Dependents (what depends on it)

**NO CODE in deliverables** - only specifications.

Example:
```markdown
### Deliverable: src/parser/variable.rs

**Purpose**: Parse template variables from input strings

**Exports**:
| Name | Type | Purpose | Used By |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `parse_variables` | fn | Extract all @ign-var:NAME@ patterns | TemplateProcessor |
| `Variable` | struct | Represents a parsed variable | Parser, Renderer |
| `ParseError` | enum | Error type for parse failures | Error handlers |

**Dependencies**:
- `src/types/template.rs` - Base template types

**Dependents**:
- `src/processor/template.rs` - Uses parse_variables
```

### 5. Subtasks

Break implementation into subtasks that can be:
- Executed independently (for concurrent implementation)
- Tracked for progress
- Assigned completion criteria

```markdown
## Subtasks

### Task 1: Core Parser Implementation
**ID**: TASK-001
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed
**Parallelizable**: Yes | No (depends on TASK-XXX)
**Deliverables**: src/parser/variable.rs
**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] parse_variables function implemented
- [ ] Variable struct defined
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Handles edge cases (empty input, nested patterns)
```

### 6. Completion Criteria

Overall feature completion requirements:
- All subtasks completed
- Integration tests pass
- Documentation updated
- Code review completed

### 7. Progress Log

Track session-by-session progress:
```markdown
## Progress Log

### Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Tasks Completed**: TASK-001, TASK-002
**Tasks In Progress**: TASK-003
**Blockers**: None
**Notes**: Discovered edge case in variable parsing
```

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include
- File paths and module structure
- Function signatures (name, parameters, return types)
- Trait definitions (name, purpose, methods)
- Struct/enum definitions (name, purpose, public fields)
- Dependency relationships
- Completion criteria

### What NOT to Include
- Actual implementation code
- Internal implementation details
- Algorithm implementations
- Private function implementations

### Signature Format

For functions:
```
fn function_name(param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> Result<ReturnType, Error>
  Purpose: What this function does
  Called by: Which modules/functions call this
```

For traits:
```
trait TraitName
  Purpose: What this trait represents
  Methods:
    - fn method_name(&self, params) -> ReturnType - description
  Implemented by: Which types implement this trait
```

For structs:
```
struct StructName
  Purpose: What this struct represents
  Fields:
    - field_name: Type - description (pub fields only)
  Used by: Which modules use this struct
```

## Parallelization Rules

Subtasks can be parallelized when:
1. No data dependencies between tasks
2. No shared file modifications
3. No order-dependent side effects

Mark dependencies explicitly:
```markdown
**Parallelizable**: No (depends on TASK-001, TASK-002)
```

## Workflow Integration

### Creating a Plan
1. Read the design document
2. Identify feature boundaries
3. Break into deliverables
4. Define subtasks with dependencies
5. Set completion criteria
6. Create plan file in `impl-plans/active/`

### During Implementation
1. Update task status as work progresses
2. Add progress log entries per session
3. Note blockers and decisions
4. Update completion criteria checkboxes

### Completing a Plan
1. Verify all completion criteria met
2. Update status to Completed
3. Add final progress log entry
4. Move file to `impl-plans/completed/`
