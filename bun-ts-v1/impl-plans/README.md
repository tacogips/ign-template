# Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans that translate design documents into actionable implementation specifications.

## Purpose

Implementation plans bridge design documents (what to build) and actual code (how to build). They provide:
- Clear deliverables without code
- Interface and function specifications
- Dependency mapping for concurrent execution
- Progress tracking across sessions

## Directory Structure

```

│   └── <feature>.md       # Completed plans for reference
└── templates/             # Plan templates
    └── plan-template.md   # Standard plan template
```

## PROGRESS.json (Task Status Index)

**CRITICAL**: `PROGRESS.json` is the central task status index used by `impl-exec-auto`.

Reading all plan files at once causes context overflow (>200K tokens). Instead:
1. `impl-exec-auto` reads only `PROGRESS.json` (~2K tokens)
2. Identifies executable tasks from this index
3. Reads specific plan files only when executing tasks
4. Updates BOTH the plan file AND `PROGRESS.json` after each task

### Structure

```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2026-01-06T16:00:00Z",
  "phases": {
    "1": { "status": "COMPLETED" },
    "2": { "status": "READY" }
  },
  "plans": {
    "plan-name": {
      "phase": 2,
      "status": "Ready",
      "tasks": {
        "TASK-001": { "status": "Not Started", "parallelizable": true, "deps": [] },
        "TASK-002": { "status": "Completed", "parallelizable": true, "deps": [] }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Keeping PROGRESS.json in Sync

After ANY task status change:
1. Edit the task status in `PROGRESS.json`
2. Update `lastUpdated` timestamp
3. Edit the task status in the plan file

## File Size Limits

**IMPORTANT**: Implementation plan files must stay under 400 lines to prevent OOM errors.

| Metric | Limit |
|--------|-------|
| Line count | MAX 400 lines |
| Modules per plan | MAX 8 modules |
| Tasks per plan | MAX 10 tasks |

Large features are split into multiple related plans with cross-references.

## Active Plans

| Plan | Status | Design Reference | Last Updated |
|------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| (No active plans yet) | - | - | - |

## Completed Plans

| Plan | Completed | Design Reference |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| (No completed plans yet) | - | - |

## Phase Dependencies (for impl-exec-auto)

**IMPORTANT**: This section is used by impl-exec-auto to determine which plans to load.
Only plans from eligible phases should be read to minimize context loading.

### Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Depends On |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | READY | - |
| 2 | BLOCKED | Phase 1 |
| 3 | BLOCKED | Phase 2 |
| 4 | BLOCKED | Phase 3 |

### Phase to Plans Mapping

```
PHASE_TO_PLANS = {
  1: [
    # Add Phase 1 plan files here
  ],
  2: [
    # Add Phase 2 plan files here
  ],
  3: [
    # Add Phase 3 plan files here
  ],
  4: [
    # Add Phase 4 plan files here
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### Creating a New Plan

1. Use the `/impl-plan` command with a design document reference
2. Or manually create a plan using `templates/plan-template.md`
3. Save to `active/<feature-name>.md`
4. Update this README with the new plan entry
5. **IMPORTANT**: Update `PROGRESS.json` with the new plan and its tasks
6. **IMPORTANT**: If plan exceeds 400 lines, split into multiple files

### Working on a Plan

1. Read `PROGRESS.json` to check task status
2. Read the active plan for task details
3. Select a subtask to work on (consider dependencies)
4. Implement following the deliverable specifications
5. Update task status in BOTH the plan file AND `PROGRESS.json`
6. Mark completion criteria as done

### Completing a Plan

1. Verify all completion criteria are met
2. Update status to "Completed" in both plan and PROGRESS.json
3. Move file from `active/` to `completed/`
4. Update this README
5. Update PROGRESS.json (remove or mark plan as completed)

## Guidelines

- Plans contain NO implementation code
- Plans specify interfaces, functions, and file structures
- Subtasks should be as independent as possible for parallel execution
- Always update progress log after each session
- **Keep each plan file under 400 lines** - split if necessary
- **Always keep PROGRESS.json in sync** with plan file statuses
